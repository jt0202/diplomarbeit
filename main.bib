abstract = {This paper reports on the development and formal verification (proof of semantic preservation) of CompCert, a compiler from Clight (a large subset of the C programming language) to PowerPC assembly code, using the Coq proof assistant both for programming the compiler and for proving its correctness. Such a verified compiler is useful in the context of critical software and its formal verification: the verification of the compiler guarantees that the safety properties proved on the source code hold for the executable compiled code as well.},

abstract="The DRAT-trim tool is a satisfiability proof checker based on the new DRAT proof format. Unlike its predecessor, DRUP-trim, all presently known SAT solving and preprocessing techniques can be validated using DRAT-trim. Checking time of a proof is comparable to the running time of the proof-producing solver. Memory usage is also similar to solving memory consumption, which overcomes a major hurdle of resolution-based proof checkers. The DRAT-trim tool can emit trimmed formulas, optimized proofs, and new TraceCheck{\thinspace}+{\thinspace} dependency graphs. We describe the output that is produced, what optimizations have been made to check RAT clauses, and potential applications of the tool.",
