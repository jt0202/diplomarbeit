\chapter*{Abstract}
    Datalog is a logic programming language widely used in database and knowledge representation use cases. Datalog engines compute the results and are optimized to handle millions of facts. Unfortunately, formally verifying these datalog engines is out of reach due to the complexity of the implementation of these optimizations. Modern datalog engines offer however proofs why an element was derived.

    We propose a checker for these proofs. The checker is implemented in Lean and formally proven to be correct against our formalization of datalog. Proofs can be given in two formats: trees and directed graphs. The input can be given as JSON files. Proofs only explain why an element is in the solution but do not tell us that a derivation is complete. Therefore we implement a certified model checker to check the completeness of a solution. We use the checker to validate the results of the datalog engine Nemo and see that validating datalog proofs is fast in most use cases. Proof graphs appear better in practice as they can reuse atoms in the proofs and are faster prepared.
